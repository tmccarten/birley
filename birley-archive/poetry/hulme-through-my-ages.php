    <div class="serif-text">
    <p>Concrete concrete concrete<br>
    Burning shimmering dusty concrete -<br>
    the balconies the crescents the walkways, concrete<br>
    to climb on jump on fall down on<br>
    grit indented on knees</p>

    <p>Tribes of kids running and screaming on dried out patches<br>
    of hard core grass that refused to give up</p>

    <p>On good days<br>
    life dictated by your next adventure<br>
    under the crescents play scheme or over the bridge park</p>

    <p>Up at the crack of dawn,<br>
    already dressed, nearly out the door,<br>
    then I here her - oi!<br>
    All the belly! You can get me messages before you go off<br>
    gallivanting with yourself. A ham shank and a bottle of sterra!</p>

    <p>Off I run down the balcony, heart beating fast –<br>
    I'm going faster than the six million dollar man!<br>
    Run down three steps<br>
    jump down five. I'm dreaming of that tyre swing!</p>

    <p>Here you are mam, i'm at the door...madam Falange<br>
    you can take your sister with you.<br>
    Gutted! I stomp down the landing with our Mandy shrieking behind me.</p>

    <p>Get down the stairs,<br>
    sneak a quick glance<br>
    up at the flat she's there,<br>
    so I bend down all concerned like<br>
    and say to our Mandy</p>

    <p>&ldquo;if you button it you can have some of me blackjacks&rdquo;,<br>
    but I don't swear just in case me mam can lip read.</p>

    <p>A backing track made up &ldquo;save all your kisses for me&rdquo;,<br>
    whilst our liz forced me to learn the dance routine even though I hated it!</p>

    <p>Gangs of catholic kids attend the evangelical Sunday school -<br>
    a great free babysitting service when the mothers<br>
    were nursing a head.</p>

    <p>Mothers shouting from three floors up chanting a list of their kids names<br>
    and if you were out of hearing range<br>
    some kid would find you:<br>
    &ldquo;Your mam’s shouting… your well in for it!&rdquo;<br>
    Mumbling old men and dads muted in the background<br>
    tobacco stained brown</p>

    <p>The women loud brash survivors,<br>
    battle faced - faced life head on with a smile,<br>
    sometimes brittle or fragile but always there just the same.</p>

    <p>My mam - Irish Kath, mother by day, party girl by night,<br>
    packs of American tan tights size extra large,<br>
    ten park drive and a bottle of Guinness for me blood.<br>
    On special nights pan stick and cherry b.</p>

    <p>Little Margaret, Big Margaret and singing Esther<br>
    with her bright red coarse beehive hair that didn't move<br>
    an inch in the most legendary of her fights.<br>
    You could work out time and what type of night she had<br>
    as she left Hulme labour club<br>
    with the sound of Esther's Argument followed by a song<br>
    and her cork platforms clonking unsteadily towards the chippy.</p>

    <p>As I lay next to our Caroline in the big bed<br>
    with the window wide open and the heat wrapping me<br>
    into a dream like state</p>

    <p>New Hulme… old voices faded echos<br>
    like the concrete blasted or crumbling into oblivion<br>
    to make way for the new builds, new faces and a sense of<br>
    respectability that didn't sit comfortably with those left behind.<br>
    The die hards: those who still wanted bicarbonate of soda<br>
    and boiling bacon in the shops<br>
    where now they only sell hummus and kale.</p>

    <p>We're just a community of ghosts love, he said<br>
    We're just a community of ghosts<br>
    These invisible souls drifting amongst us like air like light<br>
    like they’re almost too frightened to take up this tiny pinhole<br>
    of space that as a community we've allowed them.</p>

    <p>But these men, they worked brick by brick<br>
    stone by stone, pint by pint, worked with all their might<br>
    carrying back fingers crack hard like steel.</p>

    <p>Young boys with men's jobs<br>
    earning a few bob sending it all home<br>
    to a land of make believe.</p>

    <p>So they worked and they worked but how they suffered<br>
    for this land<br>
    eyes became bleary hearts, became weary, quieter<br>
    and quieter they grew</p>

    <p>Until suddenly they aren't big men<br>
    They sit and think back when, well when<br>
    my life was.</p>

    <p>But if you listen carefully you can still hear the gentlest whisper<br>
    and sense the tiniest tremor<br>
    beneath their Celtic heartbeats<br>
    of dreams of passion of a grand old tale<br>
    that might just happen</p>

    <p>I see you you and you and the sparks sharp edges<br>
    unspoken pledges winning and losing loving and leaving<br>
    wearing your heart like a road map of just dreaming<br>
    dreaming, dreaming…</p>

    <p>You boys you’re still warriors</p>

    <p>And now the dust has settled in Hulme<br>
    we begin to hear a heartbeat returning.<br>
    You will see some of our tribe<br>
    shaking down their feathers<br>
    peeking out behind the new apartments and University buildings.</p>

    <p>We recognise each other<br>
    we have part concrete in our veins<br>
    it gives us strength knowledge and determination<br>
    to come together<br>
    to rise and fly like only a true Hulmite can.</p>

    <p>We are here to RECLAIM! In order to have a community that shares<br>
    we need a community that cares. We need our spaces filled<br>
    with the old the new temporary or just visiting.</p>

    <p>Filled with the legends. The believers, dreamers, the thinkers and<br>
    the solitary figures. Hulme was and still is a home to ALL.<br>
    Inclusive risk taking and forever changing.</p>

    <p>A place that inspires and captures your heart like the softest rainfall</p>

    <p>My Hulme</p>
