    <p>Between 2011 and 2012, the university commissioned an archaeological investigation on the site that was to become the Birley development.</p>
    <p>The <a href="#" class="main-text__link">fascinating report</a> reveals the layers of history that lie beneath the site of the university campus; its alternative foundations that take the site through agricultural land, industrial landscapes, beautiful churches and urban regeneration.</p>
    <p>In March 2013, an exhibition was held of the finds. Further information can be found at the Universityâ€™s <a href="#" class="main-text__link">Special Collections</a>, based on the third floor of the Library at the All Saints Campus.</p>
