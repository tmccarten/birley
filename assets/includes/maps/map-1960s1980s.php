      <p>A much loved and respected comprehensive, Birley High School welcomed its first pupils in 1967. Taking its name from Herbert Birley (1870-1885), the first Chairman of the Manchester School Board, Birley High was an exponent of forward-thinking and inclusive education.</p>
      <p>The flame red phoenix emblem of the school symbolised the rebirth of the 1960's regeneration of Hulme. Hulme Business Park now occupies the former site of Birley High.</p>
