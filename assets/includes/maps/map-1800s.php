      <p>The biggest development of workers’ houses in the industrial era was from the mid to late 1800s. The site and its surroundings formed a grid like pattern of streets, much of which was
      terraced housing. When built, the houses had small individual rear yards with ‘privies’: outdoor toilets.</p>
      <p>The terraces were cleared for a programme of new housing development in the 1960s.</p>
